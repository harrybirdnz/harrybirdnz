      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <h3>Enchilada Sauce</h3>
      <ol class="list-decimal pl-5">
        <li>
          To make the enchilada sauce, heat the vegetable oil in a small
          saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour, chili powder, cumin, garlic
          powder, onion powder, and salt, and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring
          constantly, until the flour is lightly toasted.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gradually whisk in the chicken broth and diced tomatoes and bring the
          sauce to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10-15
          minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large mixing bowl, combine the shredded chicken, black beans,
          corn, onion, garlic, cheese, olive oil, chili powder, cumin, paprika,
          salt, and pepper. Stir until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Enchiladas</h3>
      <ol class="list-decimal pl-5">
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and lightly grease a
          9x13-inch baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fry the chicken in large chunks in a pan until cooked through. Remove
          from pan, and allow to cool before shredding.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large mixing bowl, combine the shredded chicken, black beans,
          corn, onion, garlic, cheese, olive oil, chili powder, cumin, paprika,
          salt, and pepper. Stir until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>
          5. To assemble the enchiladas, spoon a small amount of the chicken and
          black bean mixture onto a corn tortilla, and roll it up tightly. Place
          the enchilada seam-side down in the prepared baking dish. Repeat with
          the remaining tortillas and filling.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour the enchilada sauce over the enchiladas, and sprinkle with
          additional shredded cheese, if desired.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake the enchiladas for 20-25 minutes, or until the sauce is bubbly
          and the cheese is melted and lightly browned.
        </li>
        <li>Serve.</li>
